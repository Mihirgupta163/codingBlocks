/*
Cody went to the market to buy some oranges for his N friends. There he finds orange wrapped in packets, with the price of i^th packet as val[i]. Now he wants to buy exactly W kg oranges, so he wants you to tell him what minimum price he should pay to buy exactly W kg oranges. Weight of i^th packet is i kg. If price of i^th packet is -1 then this packet is not available for sale. The market has infinite supply of orange packets.

Input Format
First line of input contains two space separated integers N and W, the number of friend he has and the amount of Oranges in kilograms which he should buy.

The second line contains W space separated integers in which the i^th^ integer specifies the price of a ‘i’kg apple packet. A value of -1 denotes that the corresponding packet is unavailable

Constraints
1 <= N,W,val[ ] <= 10^3

Output Format
Output a single integer denoting the minimum price Code should pay to get exactly W kg oranges. Else print -1 if it is not possible to fill the bag.

Sample Input
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output
